            Megaworld Corporation, founded by Dr. Andrew Tan on August 24, 1989,
            is a prominent real estate company in the Philippines. Initially,
            Megaworld gained recognition for developing high-end residential
            condominiums and commercial properties in strategic urban locations
            across Metro Manila. In 1996, the company shifted its focus towards
            mixed-use community development, addressing the growing demand for
            integrated living, working, and leisure spaces. This strategic pivot
            is exemplified by projects like Eastwood City, which cater to the
            middle-income demographic. Beyond real estate development, Megaworld
            engages in project design, construction supervision, and property
            management, ensuring comprehensive service delivery. A significant
            milestone in its corporate journey occurred on August 19, 1999, when
            Megaworld rebranded to reflect its evolution into a holding company
            while maintaining its commitment to real estate excellence. Over the
            past 33 years, Megaworld has solidified its position as the foremost
            developer of residential and office spaces in the Philippines,
            consistently adapting to changing market dynamics. Dr. Andrew L.
            Tan, the visionary founder and Chairman, pioneered the
            Live-Work-Play-Learn township concept. This innovative approach
            integrates residential buildings, office towers, commercial hubs,
            and luxury accommodations within vibrant communities, setting
            Megaworld apart and underscoring its dedication to creating holistic
            urban environments that cater to diverse lifestyle needs.
